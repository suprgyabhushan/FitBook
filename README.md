# Fit-Game-Website
1. These are the codes regarding my project of making a fit game in which I am able to integrate the Google Fit App to my fitness website.
2. This project is related with web development.
3. This project will be able to show your all information regarding your steps taken at different times in a day in a table.
4. Now I want to do more advancements in the project where on the total steps a person has walked , I can give them ranks.
5. This can then become a proper FIT-GAME-WEBSITE.
